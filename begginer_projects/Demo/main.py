#1. Create a greeting for your program.
# print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator")
# #2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.
# city = input("What's name of the city you grew up in?\n")
# #3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.
# pet = input("What's name of a pet?\n")
# #4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
# print(city+pet)
# #5. Make sure the input cursor shows on a new line:

# ------------------------------
#2. If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.

#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

# print("Welcome to the tip calculator.")
# bill = float(input("What was teh total bill?\n"))
# tip = int(input("What percentage tip would you like to give? 10,12, or 15?\n"))
# pers = int(input("How many people to split the bill?\n"))
# tip_as_percent = tip / 100
# total_tip_amount = bill * tip_as_percent
# total_bill = bill + total_tip_amount
# bill_per_person = total_bill / pers
# final_amount = "{:2f}".format(bill_per_person)
# print(f"Each person should pay: ${final_amount}")
